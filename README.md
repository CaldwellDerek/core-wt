## Description
This was originally a collaborative project done between myself and my classmates. The original repository can be found [HERE](https://github.com/Raflores10/workout-tracker). I sought to build this project on my own as a way to challenge myself and continually learn. 

This fullstack application allows you to create an account and keep track of your progress in the Gym. At this time, Core focuses on three core exercises, Bench Press, Squat, and Deadlift. With your account you can record your progress and see how far you've come in your weightlifting journey as well as research, create and save workouts / exercises.
